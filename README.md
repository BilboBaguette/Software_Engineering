# Software_Engineering

A few precisions on the GitHub: This is our second GitHub repository for this project. We encountered huge issues (due to the fact that we didn’t have any experience with GitHub and basically didn’t know what we were doing) when merging branches on our first repository, to the point where the code was completely broken. We chose to recreate a new repository to be able to start from a clean slate and do things right. However, in a fit of incompetence-induced lack of judgment, we deleted the first repository once we had successfully created the second, which, in retrospect, really wasn’t a smart thing to do because it still served a purpose in showing the work we had done.
Basically, the point of this paragraph is to assure you that we did not in fact create the GitHub repository basically one week before handing out the project. Sadly, we don’t have anything but our word to show for it.

For clarity purpose, because we didn't think about it when we created our GitHub accounts:
Aqualio=Nils
BilboBaguette=Roman
Beuhlex=Aurélien
